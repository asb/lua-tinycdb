Description:
  A binding to the tinycdb[1] library by Michael Tokarev,
  which is a public domain implementation of Daniel J. Bernstein's Constant 
  Database (cdb)[2]. A cdb is a key-value store (much like BDB/gdbm), but it 
  cannot be updated at runtime (only rebuilt). Reading is very fast, and 
  rebuilding is done atomically by building the new database and then 
  renaming. Includes the tinycdb source so there are no external dependencies. 

  I include below the list of advantages of the cdb database structure, stolen 
  (and slightly modified) from D.J. Bernstein's cdb page:
    * Fast lookups: A successful lookup in a large database normally takes 
      just two disk accesses. An unsuccessful lookup takes only one.
    * Low overhead: A database uses 2048 bytes, plus 24 bytes per record, plus 
      the space for keys and data.
    * Fast atomic database replacement

      A lua interface using D.J. Bernstein's original cdb library. lua-tinycdb 
      was developed independently.
